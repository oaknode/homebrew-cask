Consent to Use of Data
You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and Software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of Software updates, product support, and other services to you, if any, related to the Software. We may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve our products or to provide services or technologies to you.

External Services
The Software enables access to third-party software, services and websites (collectively and individually, “External Services”). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services, including the security or functionality of any such third-party External Services. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. To the extent you choose to use any External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws or other licenses or terms related to such External Services. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.

Disclaimers
You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Software is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Software is provided “as is” and “as available,” with all faults and without warranty of any kind, and Licensor hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the Software, either express, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and of noninfringement of third-party rights. No oral or written information or advice given by Licensor or its authorized representative shall create a warranty. Should the Software prove defective, you assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the above exclusion and limitations may not apply to you.

Licensor is a developer of software. Licensor does not operate a virtual currency or derivatives exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and therefore has no oversight, involvement, or control with respect to your transactions on any blockchain protocol (“Protocol”). 

You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to your transactions on any Protocol, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

You understand that Licensor is not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC, or any financial regulatory authority. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Licensor software. This Software does not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security or other asset. Licensor is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person.

Licensor does not own or control the underlying Protocols that are used or accessed in connection with the Software. In general, the Protocols are open-source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. Licensor is not responsible for operation of the Protocols, and Licensor makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability, including any files stored via the InterPlanetary File System or any other peer-to-peer file storage mechanism.

    You acknowledge that your account data may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, including software failures, viruses or other harmful materials, Protocol changes, Forks (defined below), Internet outages, node outages or failures, force majeure event or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or outside Licensor’s control. You are solely responsible for backing up and maintaining duplicate copies of any information you store or transfer using the Software.

    Blockchain is an independent public peer-to peer network and the underlying software Protocols are not owned or controlled in any way or manner by Licensor. In general, the underlying Protocols are open-source, and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. Licensor is not responsible for the operation of the underlying Protocols and Licensor makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability. The underlying Protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (“Forks”), and such Forks may materially affect the name, value and function of the Protocols that the Software supports. In the event of a Fork, Licensor may suspend access to the Software and Licensor may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) the original Protocol and the Forked version of the Protocol. You acknowledge and agree that Licensor assumes no responsibility in respect of an unsupported Forked version of any Protocol. To the extent Licensor makes certain third-party blockchain node software available for download through the Software, the offering of such third-party software for download does not constitute an endorsement of such third-party software or the underlying Protocol, nor does it constitute an acknowledgement that such third-party software or underlying Protocol is safe to use. 

Licensor does not support the exchange or offer of any digital currencies or tokens through the Software. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use the Software to store, send, request, or receive digital currencies or tokens in any form. Licensor assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use the Software for any digital currency or token transactions. 
Limitation of Liability
To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, in no event shall Licensor be liable for personal injury or any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever, including damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Software, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, or otherwise) and even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for personal injury, or of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for the use of the Software. 

Export Control and Government End Users

(a) You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Software except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Software was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Software may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons. 

(b) The Software and related documentation are “Commercial Items,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.
Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Venue
Any dispute arising from this EULA and your use of the Software will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The arbitration provisions set forth in the OAKnode Terms of Service will apply to any disputes arising from this EULA or your use of the Software. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California.

Risk Factors
You acknowledge the following serious risks to any use of the Software and expressly agree to not hold Licensor liable should any of the following risks occur:
Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions: The Software could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Licensor to continue to develop the Software, or which could impede or limit your ability to use the Software. 

Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Software: The Software is novel and there is a risk that the Licensor, or other third parties not directly affiliated with Licensor, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Software causing the Software to lose connection to a Protocol or one or more of your accounts or other accounts. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Software, the Software may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Software.

Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography: Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Software. To the extent within its control and otherwise possible, Licensor intends to update Software to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.

Risk of Blockchain Network Attacks: Any Protocol used in connection with the Software may be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to: double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and work race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Protocols used in the Software, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Known or novel mining attacks may be successful. 

Miscellaneous
The failure of Licensor to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this EULA will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this EULA are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, this EULA is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and is not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.
